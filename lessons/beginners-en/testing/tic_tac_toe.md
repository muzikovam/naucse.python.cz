# One-dimensional tic-tac-toe

You plan 1-D tic-tac-toe on a board which has one row with 20 spaces.

There are two players. 
The first player make a move by putting `x` to an empty space.
The second player puts `o`. Then the first player plays again.

For example:
1. move: `-------x------------`
2. move: `-------x--o---------`
3. move: `-------xx-o---------`
4. move: `-------xxoo---------`
5. move: `------xxxoo---------`
   
They player who puts three same symbols next to each other wins.

## Assignment 1

Write a function `evaluate` that gets a string with the board of 1D tic-tac-toe
and returns one character based on the state of the game:

- `"x"` – The player who uses crosses (Xs) wins (the board contains `xxx`)
- `"o"` – The player who uses noughts (Os) wins (the board contains `ooo`)
- `"!"` – Draw (the board is full but nobody wins)
- `"-"` – Otherwise (i.e. the game is not finished)
