# Git

Whether you code or write documents, often you end up
with multiple versions of the same file.
You may want to archive one set of changes that are not needed at the moment,
then send another set of changes to your colleagues for a review.
At a certain point, keeping track of all these versios becomes unfeasible.

Tools like Dropbox or Google Drive, which you may know already, can help a bit.
These tools allow you to share your files easily or to restore their content
to an earlier point in time.
Here's an example:

{{ figure(
    img=static('dropbox.png'),
    alt="Versioning interface in Dropbox"
) }}

Unfortunatelly, you can only see different versions of a *single file*.
Also, it's hard to tell which version you might want to restore since
there is no indication of how individual versions differ.
A relatively large project wouldn't be manaegable with this approach.

Therefore, programmers tend to use more powerful tools
dubbed *version control system* (VCS).
Currently the most popular one is Git and we'll learn more about it in this lesson.

## Installation

The process of installing Git is described 
[here]({{ lesson_url('git/install') }}).
If you skipped the lesson before, you might want to get back to it now.


## Repository

Each project that you want to version-control needs to be stored in its own directory.
Create a new directory now and navigate inside (use command `cd`).
Then, create a new Git <em>repository</em> using the command `git init`:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ./.git/
```

At first glance, it looks like nothing happened.
This command created a *hidden* directory with the name `.git` and stored some information in there.
You can see it using `ls -a` (Linux) or `dir /a` (Windows).
`.git` is a hidden directory because it should be managed only by Git
and you shouldn't be changing anything inside.

The repository is empty for now.
You can see for yourself by invoking `git status`, a command that shows information
about the state of the reposuitory:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

*“On branch master”* refers to so called branches, we'll get back to that later.
*“Initial commit”* means that there is no revision stored yet.
And *“nothing to commit”* says that there are no files to be saved and versioned in the directory.


## First revision

Try adding something to Git now!

Create a new file `poem.txt` and write a short poem inside.
It should span at least five lines so that we have enough to work with.
Then, try executing `git status` again: Git reports that there is a new
file in the directory and that it isn't managed by Git yet.

<!-- XXX: Color coding! -->

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        ␛[31mpoem.txt␛[m

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

We need to make Git track any new file explicitely.
Let's do that for the file with your poem:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git add poem.txt
```

Then check the state of the repository again:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        ␛[32mnew file:   poem.txt␛[m

```

The lines in green (“changes to be committed”)
will be included in the next batch of changes (a *commit*) that you will create.
Let's create our first commit:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git commit
[master (root-commit) 1a009f4] First revision
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 poem.txt
```

After entering this command, an editor opens where you can write a short description 
of this commit, briefly summarizing what changes have been made.
This is refferred to as a *commit message*. For now, simple `First revision` will do.
You can ignore the existing lines starting with `#`, these are just for your information.
Git will ignore them as well. Finally, save the file and close the editor.

Try reporting on the repository again:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This short report means that nothing has changed since the last commit.
That is expected since we've just commited all our changes!

Now let's have a look at what has changed in the last commit.
Execute `git show`:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git show

## Second revision

Make a small change in your poem; replace one word,
change puntuation or add a new verse.
Then check the status of the Git repository again.

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        ␛[31mmodified:   poem.txt␛[m

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The file is shown in red again. Something has changed inside!
To see the details, execute the command <code>git diff</code>.

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git diff
␛[1mdiff --git a/poem.txt b/poem.txt␛[m

The changes are shown on a per-line basis.
The lines in <tt class="red">red</tt> beginning with <tt class="red">-</tt> indicate
the original lines that have been removed;
the lines in <tt class="green">green</tt> starting with <tt class="green">+</tt>
show the newly added lines.

It is that easy to see what exactly has changed since the last commit.
If your program stops working but the last commited version still worked,
use <code>git diff</code> –
one of the changes listed must have introduced the error!

> [note]
> The line beginning with <tt class="blue">@@</tt> indicates the location in the file

> starts at line 1 as well but it is 9 lines long.

If you are satisfied with the changes, stage them for the next commit:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git add poem.txt
```

As usual, check the `status` of the repository; the file in green will be included
within the next commit.

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        ␛[32mmodified:   poem.txt␛[m

```

Before we finalize the next commit, let's talk about the best practices
in formulating the commit messages.
There are common conventions that most programmers follow:
the first line summarizes the changes, the second line is left blank,
and the following lines list the reasons for the change or describe
the changes themselves in more details.
Each line should have under 70 characters in length;
the lenth of the comments (lines starting with `#`) can serve as a guide here.
It is not worth going into details for changes that are trivial or obvious;
rather, focus on the broader context and reasons for the changes.
Anything that can help whoever will try to understand the changes in the commit;
this might include you few months later.

My commit message will be the following:

```plain
Split long lines

Typically, each verse of a poem goes on its own line. I think
that it's easier to read like this. (Although, the real reason was 
to demonstrate git diff.)
```

> [note]
> If you ever have trouble summarizing your changes using
> just 70 characters, you might be taking too many steps at once.
> E.g. "change string X and add loop Y"
> might be better to commit as two separate revisions.

Finally, use `git commit` to create your second revision,
and then check it using `git show`:

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git show

The diagram below visualizes what each command demonstrated thus far does exactly,

## Log

Now that we have created first few revisions in our repository,
let's demonstrate more commands that will help us to understand
the whole history of a GIt repository.
The first command is <code>git log</code>.

```ansi
␛[36m$␛[0m git log
␛[33mcommit 81cbabb3bd3cd2f3896dd41b20012c44dbd69031␛[m

Author: Adéla Novotná <adela.novotna@example.cz>
Date:   Mon Mar 20 14:51:34 2017 +0100

    First revision
```

<code>git log</code> prints all commits starting from the newest one and going
all the way back to the initial commit at the origin of the repository.

When there are enough commits that they don't fit on a single screen
of your command line window, you can browse back and forth using
<kbd>PgUp</kbd>/<kbd>PgDn</kbd>.
Finally, exit by pressing <kbd>q</kbd>.


> [note]
> There are many options that customize the output of `git log`.
> They are all described (at great length)
> in the built-in documentation (command `git help log`).
> If the help is displayed in the command line window, press <kbd>q</kbd>
> to exit.
>
> My personal favorite combination is `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --cherry-mark --boundary`.

To see all details about any commit,
execute `git show 5ff0b`, replacing `5ff0b`
with the first few characters of the <span class="yellow">Git commit ID</span>.

## gitk

The command line can convey all sorts of information,
but not always in a clear way.
Graphical application called *gitk* offers a more intuitive view
at the history of your repository;
you can start it using the command `gitk --all`:

```console
$ gitk --all
```

{{ figure(
    img=static('gitk.png'),
    alt="Graphical application Gitk",
) }}


The application doesn't look very appealing (almost as if
it has been designed by programmers who ephasise substance over form),
but it will suit our needs.
Get familiar with it first, then close it, commit few more sets of changes
and finally explore them using `git log` and `gitk --all`.

## Conclusion

These are the Git basics that we'll need in the following lessons.
Whenever you perform <code>git add <var>file</var></code> and `git commit`,
the current version of the file is saved and will be accessible even if you delete the file later.
You can always view any past version of any file in your repository,
and review all changes made since the last time the project was saved.

Maybe all this sounded unnecessarily too complicated for a beginner.
Indeed, our projects will be relatively simple and easy to manage
even without the use of Git.
But it's a good idea to learn using it from the very beginning;
when you get to participate on bigger projects, already being used to Git
will come very handy.

So, from now on, whenever you make even a small but meaningful change to your program,
as long as the program works at least as well as it did before,
use `git add` and `git commit` to save the change in Git.
